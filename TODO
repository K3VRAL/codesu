TODOs

char *fileInMemory -> char **fileInMemory
NOTE: This also means that these functions will have to be changed
    - indexAtCharOfLine(int index)
    - lineAtIndex(int index)

char stringbuilder[500] -> char *stringbuilder

In src/lib/files.c , change lineAtIndex 's return value such that we don't need to free the return value after it returned.

Do the documentation for Loop[ and Loop] in doc/en/ctbrainfuck.md

In main.c, free all the relevant allocated resources.
